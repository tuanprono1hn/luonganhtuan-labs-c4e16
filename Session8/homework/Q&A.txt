- Why should we use functions at all?
	A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. We can call it when we want to use it, need not to code again.
- How to define/declare a function?
	def name_of_function(arguments/parameters):
		statements
- How to call/use a function?
	name_of_function(arguments/parameters)
- What is return, why and how do we use it?
	The return statement is used to escape the function definition and take the result of function.
	Everything in a funcion can't be used out of function so we have to take what we need to use outta function.
	To use it, we need a variable to assign a result returned: res = return(result)
- Do we have to use return in every function?
	No, we don't
- What are function arguments/parameters, why and how we use it?
	The first type of data is the data that is passed in the function call. This data is called an argument. Arguments can be constants, variables or expressions.
	The second type of data is the data received in the function definition. This data is called a parameter. Parameters must be variables to keep values coming.
	All parameters/arguments in the Python language are passed by reference. It means if you change what a parameter refers to within a function, the change also reflects back in the calling function.
	Ex: def name_of_function(x, y):
		z = x + y
		print(z)
		return z
	    name_of_function(5, 6)
